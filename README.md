# Landing
Just a simple landing page, practice with functional JS

Taken from tutorial @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=133&v=fSTQzlprGLI&feature=emb_logo 

I found this tutorial here: https://dev.to/simonholdorf/9-awesome-projects-you-can-build-with-vanilla-javascript-2o1b 

Wanted to build a simple page, and then make modifications.

Two things I need to do:
 * Update the jpgs in the style to be presented better
 * Change to use more pure functional JS programming 

I should also note that the current pics were taken from here: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/jesus
